# Contributing

Competitive programming is a passion of mine I and would love to share it with
anyone and everyone. There are many competitive programmers that have their own
librarys of code that they use just for themselves but there is very little of 
them that have maintained libraries that everyone can use. 

It is my intention to maintain this library and to make it as easy as possible
for anyone to use it as they wish. For the time being I will leave my own problem
solutions in this repository for examples of how to use the library.

If you would like to contribute to this library please do! I would love nothing
more than to work with someone who enjoys programming as much as I do. Even
if your not sure if your idea is good or not or how to implement it please
at least raise an issue.

Issues should be used to describe what needs to be done, weither it is a bug
or a feature. 

I would love to work on any and all of your ideas and if you would also like to
work on the feature along side me please do! Simply raise an issue and connect
a new branch.

I welcome all contributions from entire classes to small formatting changes. ðŸ’™

I love working with people so please don't be shy to share your ideas!
