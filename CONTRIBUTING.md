# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this library please do! I would love nothing
more than to work with someone who enjoys programming as much as I do. Even
if your not sure if your idea is good or not or how to implement it please
at least raise an issue.

Issues should be used to describe what needs to be done, whether it is a bug
or a feature. 

I would love to work on any and all of your ideas and if you would also like to
work on the feature along side me please do! Simply raise an issue and connect
a new branch.

I welcome all contributions from entire classes to small formatting changes. ðŸ’™

I love working with people so please don't be shy to share your ideas!
