# C++ CPL (Competitive Programming Library)

![Clang Format Check](https://github.com/BrandonPacewic/CompetitiveProgramming/actions/workflows/clang-format-check.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

Competitive programming is a passion of mine I and would love to share it with
anyone and everyone.

It is my intention to maintain this library and to make it as easy as possible
for anyone to use it as they wish.

## Library Languages

If you where to pick any language to use for competitive programming it would
definitely be C++. Mainly in terms of efficiency and the capabilities of the
Standard Library. For these reasons all of the source code is written in C++.

Python is included for testing, CMake is included for compiling the library.

## Starting Competitive Programming

If your not sure where to start I recommend HackerRank, Codewars, LeetCode, and
CodeForces to start. The bigger competitions such as Google Code Jam and
Facebook Hacker Cup are also fantastic but they have a slightly higher
barrier of entry.

If you are looking for a book to read checkout the
[Competitive Programmerâ€™s Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) by Antti
Laaksonen.

If you are looking for people to watch I recommend the following people:

- [William Lin](https://www.youtube.com/c/WilliamLin168)

## How to consume

You will need a copy of the source code saved locally
in order to use it. Simply create a clone of the repository and put it in
a easy to access location. Then just copy and paste code whenever you need it.

This is an unfortunate side effect of how competitive programming contests work. All of your code outside what the compiler includes must
be submitted with your solution, all in one file. For this reason the code in this library is build in a way that allows it to work and be compiled separately from the library itself.
