# Competitive Programming

Competitive programming is a passion of mine I and would love to share it with
anyone and everyone. There are many competitive programmers that have their own
librarys of code that they use just for themselves but there is very little of 
them that have maintained libraries that everyone can use. 

It is my intention to maintain this library and to make it as easy as possible
for anyone to use it as they wish. For the time being I will leave my own problem
solutions in this repository for examples of how to use the library.

## Library Languages

If you where to pick any language to use for competitive programming it would
definitely be C++. Just in terms of efficiency and the capabilities of the 
Standard Library. For this reason all of the source code is written in C++. 

My codewars problem solutions are written in many different languages but that is
mostly for the sake of practice.

## Starting Competitive Programming

If your not sure where to start I recommend HackerRank, Codewars, LeetCode, and
CodeForces to start. The bigger competitions such as Google Code Jam and 
Facebook Hacker Cup are also fantastic but they have a slightly higher
barier of entry.

If you are looking for a book to read checkout the 
[Competitive Programmerâ€™s Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf) by Antti 
Laaksonen.

If you are looking for people to watch I recommend the following people:

- [William Lin](https://www.youtube.com/c/WilliamLin168)

## How to consume

You will need a copy of the source code saved locally
in order to use it. Simply create a clone of the repository and put it in
a easy to access location. Then just copy and paste code whenever you need it. 

This is an unfortunate side effect of how competitive programming contests work.
All source code needs to be placed in one file.
